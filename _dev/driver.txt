DRIVER ENROLLMENT
Drivers are handpicked to drive for the Gras platform, for now.
We need to make sure the starting team of deliveryPersons is high quality,
and perfectly fulfills the requirements of the customer and the dispensaries.

Potential drivers fill out a form on the website, to request being hired to deliver.
Drivers are handpick and background checked and verified by the staff.
Driver profiles are created by the staff using internal forms.
This keeps the process gated for now, ensuring the highest quality. :D


DRIVER APIS
The apis exist for onboarding drivers to the platform.
The foreseeable bottlenecks are the background approval process,
there is currently no automation for it.
And the background check is done manually by staff, who meet with each driver,
and personally verify their identify and their trustworthiness to drive for the platform.
As such, its a slow process that must be improved soon.
