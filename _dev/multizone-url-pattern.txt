Admin app runs on multizone of Shop app.

base url for admin app is /app to trigger the admin app.
rewrite paths for admin app are in shop app nextconfig.mjs

Rewrite paths for shop app and general rewrites and redirects are in shop/src/middleware.ts


The intended pattern for multizone rewrites is this:
when app.localhost:3000 is put in the browser, it will rewrite to localhost:3001/app, to access the admin app.
when app.grascannabis.org is put in the browser, it will rewrite to grascannabis.org/app, etc.

app.localhost:3000/welcome will rewrite to localhost:3001/app/welcome, etc.

other redirects that need to happen: 

1.  _stores cannot be accessed directly, (leads to 404)
    [store].localhost:3000, or [store].grascannabis.org will direct to the dynamic storefront page, if the subdomain exists.


2.  logging in a user with admin or owner membership will redirect to admin app. (localhost:3001/app)


3.  logging in with a user without admin or owner membership will redirect to shop app. (localhost:3000)


4.  if user is visiting first time, base url is localhost:3000.
    * after they have entered the store, a cookie will redirect base url to localhost:3000/browse
