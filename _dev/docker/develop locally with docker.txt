RUNNING DOCKER COMMANDS
Use yarn docker:* commands with args, 
or use make file commands:
    TYPE=server CONTEXT=main make docker-build
    IMAGE=server-main make docker-tag
    IMAGE=server-main make docker-push

IMPORTANT
1. Build docker images from a newly cloned repository to simulate the ci environment!
