Dev Call - Docker build with Kalipha 2-18-22
docker container is running, the app is not compiling.
I think there are some schema changes in the database, which conflict with Kaliphas branch db schema.
Also, he suggest the .yarn folder is an issue to include in the repository.
I will research the .yarn folder with docker.
