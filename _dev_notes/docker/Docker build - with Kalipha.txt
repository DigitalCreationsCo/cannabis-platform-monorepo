Dev Call - Docker build with Kalipha 2-18-22
docker container is running, the app is not compiling.
I think there are some schema changes in the database, which conflict with Kaliphas branch db schema.
Also, he suggest the .yarn folder is an issue to include in the repository.
I will research the .yarn folder with docker.

Result: Kalipha branch works with pushing old db schema from February 13.
Next steps: 
1. Solve the ssr issue on production build -> the server is not available, due to a supertokens config issue:
    production api needs https address and secure cookies for session to work.
    Solution is to deploy the node server in a Linode, with docker, and with supertokens working functionally.
    Then Kalipha can create the docker image for app, and deploy this image as well for production.

2. remove the db query from Kalipha's branch, so there is no db error.
3. provision a production branch, with db schema from Kaliphas branch. 
4. Message Kalipha by Monday, have a call to discuss the next steps
