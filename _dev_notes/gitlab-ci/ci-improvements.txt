PACKAGES
Packages are built in each module in the build process.
There is no shared build for the modules.
    Question: How can the packages be a shared module that is imported (mounted) in the module containers?

    Use docker cache from initial build layer, to inline dependency packages to module builds:
    https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/docker#usage-with-cache-from

    Builder layer => withcachefrom Builderlayer/packages/ => mount into module build as a volume.
    (will have to alter Dockerfiles as well for this config) :)

KUBERNETES DEPLOYMENT IMAGE APPLY
Modules are applied in kubernetes cluster using container-image-updates method.
passing a syntax of value pairs: 
CONTAINER_NAME_1=CONTAINER_IMAGE_1 CONTAINER_NAME_2=CONTAINER_IMAGE_2 etc
Improve: handle dynamic data using context for differnet modules.
Improve: update the service yaml file whenever an image push is made in ci. 

SCRIPTING
Figure out how to run external scripts in the config.yml, 
    Need a script to increment docker image tag for kubernetes deployment

LIST-CHANGED-MODULES
* This is not working correctly, need to resolve it.

* handle different digests for multiple module builds

TODO: (NECESSARY)
docker image builds should only happen for master branch, not for pull requests.
1. add a parameter to publish builds, and deploy to cluster

Efficient CI To Build Modules and Dependencies

1. include a gitlab-ci.yml file in each module.

2. <module>/gitlab-ci.yml contains:
jobs that extend a base module job, that is dependent on changes from node_modules,
and the path of the module itself.

3. when changes are detected,
the module jobs will run.
lint
test
build
deploy

How can I make this modular? Without adding a configuration file to each module?
# BASE_CONFIG
