Websocket functionality for locationserver:

connection to socket
open to 3 parties, initiator: Client, 2nd party: Driver, 3rd party: Vendor(observing)
implement websocket broadcast with socket.io rooms

Outline of the socket broadcast process:
The driver client will broadcast the their user coordinates 
as their client app updates with new coordinates 
Each new updated coordinate pair will be sent through 
the web socket pipe to the server the server will then 
broadcast that in the web socket room so that data will 
be picked up by the client customer app who will be tuned 
into the same web socket room ID

CURRENT STATUS:

CLIENT: MAPSCREEN
needs state machine to handle connection status
needs a function to check if socket is Connected, using socketid from redux state.
    if socket is connected, return, else reconnect or resolve it.

MIDDLEWARE

- middleware works
- it needs to be typed
