Hosting monorepo projects on Linode
    -deploying images with Docker

Some optimization can be done for the monorepo projects:
app: create docker build image

server/main: 
create a production bundle with a script, - maybe not necessary
expose the server port and serve files with nginx
run the app with pm2

1. clone the project. Start nginx. add SSL cert nginx.
2. update monorepo project to use production node server address.
3. provision prod db
4. test monorepo project for production build issues.
5. Message Kalipha on Monday to proceed. 
6. Profit.
