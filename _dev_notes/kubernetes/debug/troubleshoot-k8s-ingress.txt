There could be several reasons why your Kubernetes Ingress is not working anymore. Here are a few common issues to consider:

Configuration Errors: Check if there are any misconfigurations in your Ingress resource or associated objects such as Services or Pods. Ensure that the Ingress rules match the backend Services correctly and that the necessary annotations are present.

DNS Resolution: Verify if the DNS records for your Ingress domain are still properly configured and resolving to the correct IP addresses. If there have been any changes to the DNS settings or if the domain has expired, it can prevent the Ingress from functioning.

Network Connectivity: Ensure that your Ingress controller is reachable from the external network. Check the network configuration, firewalls, and security groups to confirm that the necessary ports (typically 80 and/or 443) are open and forwarding traffic to the Ingress controller.

Ingress Controller Failure: Check the health and status of your Ingress controller. It's possible that the Ingress controller itself is experiencing issues or has stopped running. Review the logs and monitor the relevant components to identify any errors or failures.

Cluster Issues: If you are running a Kubernetes cluster, check if there are any cluster-wide issues that may be impacting the functionality of your Ingress. Monitor the cluster components, such as the kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-proxy, for any errors or failures.

Resource Constraints: Insufficient resources, such as CPU, memory, or disk space, can cause the Ingress controller or associated components to malfunction. Check the resource utilization of your cluster nodes and ensure that there are enough resources available for the Ingress to operate properly.

Kubernetes Version Compatibility: If you recently upgraded your Kubernetes cluster or made changes to the underlying infrastructure, it's possible that there are compatibility issues with the Ingress controller or other components. Check the documentation and release notes of the Ingress controller to verify its compatibility with your Kubernetes version.

These are just some general troubleshooting steps to help you identify and resolve the issue with your Kubernetes Ingress. It's recommended to review the logs, monitor the relevant components, and consult the documentation or community resources specific to your Ingress controller for more detailed troubleshooting guidance.
