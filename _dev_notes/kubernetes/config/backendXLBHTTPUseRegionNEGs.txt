XLB Http backend is only using one NEG in zone asia-east2-a.

# Understand how to load balance vm groups in other zones. (asia-east2-b, asia-east2-c)
There are pods deployed there, but no traffic is routed from load balancer.

Solution: 
Ideally, traffic should be routed to vms in zone a,b and c, ( for redudancy and failover ).
Configure Xlb backend to serve to zone a,b,c, 
or provision a backend for each zone to serve zonal NEG.
* Ideally, have one backend to load balance all zonal NEG.

caveats: ingressgateway may need unique name for each zone, if so, pass the zone value in helm command to append to ig name.

finally: Using all zonal NEG to mitigate spot vm distruptions. 
So, it's a good idea as well to implement permanent vms as failover for deployments.
