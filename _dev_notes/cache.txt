NOTES ON CACHEING:

a cache is only effective if the data in the cache is valid.
caching the result of a database function that retrieves regularly updated data, will not be reliable
if the cache is not being invalidated on update.

The current pattern of caching I use, to cache responses data on next server from backend server,
is NOT effective, if there is no invalidating of the cache.

Solutions:
Set a TTL for cached objects, that reasonably fulfills the MOST RELEVANT cache requirements (use case)
