# Ci Strategy

Master branch is production branch.
Main branch is default development. ( rename to promote )

Master branch and Promote are protected branch, only can merge PRs. No push allowed.

## PR process
Create PR from PR branch -> Main
Approved -> merge to main

### Promote to Master
Merge to main will start automatic pipeline to run test suites, and merge to master.
Master branch will run a job to check for changed project modules.
Any changed modules will trigger image rebuild, and deploy updated images to vm.

#### Current Status
* All packages will build images with docker buildx bake.
* Images build with `latest` tag.
* There is no test suite in ci yet.
